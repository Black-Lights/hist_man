# Histogram Manipulation Library Plan

## Purpose and Overview
This library aims to provide essential functionalities for image histogram manipulation, allowing users to input multi-band images and apply various operations to enhance image contrast and distribution. The following key features will be provided:
- **Histogram Equalization**
- **Histogram Matching**
- **Linear Stretching**
- **Saturated Linear Stretching**
- **Visualization Tools** for both histograms and images

## Library Features

### 1. Image Input and Handling
- **Supported Image Types**: Grayscale, RGB, multispectral images.
- **Supported Formats**: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.tif`, etc.
- **Functionality**: 
  - Read image from file path.
  - Optionally support image input as NumPy arrays for flexibility.
  - Handle multi-band images (e.g., each band is treated separately for operations).

### 2. Histogram Equalization
- **Objective**: Enhance the contrast of an image by redistributing pixel intensities.
- **Details**:
  - Each image band (or grayscale image) will have its histogram equalized independently.
  - Provide options for both global and adaptive histogram equalization.

### 3. Histogram Matching
- **Objective**: Adjust the pixel intensity distribution of one image to match the histogram of another reference image.
- **Details**:
  - Implement matching for individual bands or full images.
  - Useful for creating visually consistent images in image processing workflows.

### 4. Linear Stretching
- **Objective**: Increase the contrast of the image by stretching the pixel values linearly between the minimum and maximum.
- **Details**:
  - Apply linear transformation to rescale pixel values to the desired range.
  - Useful for image enhancement in satellite or remote sensing imagery.

### 5. Saturated Linear Stretching
- **Objective**: Similar to linear stretching but with the added feature of clipping extreme pixel values (e.g., top 1% and bottom 1% of pixels) to enhance contrast.
- **Details**:
  - Define thresholds for clipping pixel values.
  - Provide flexibility in adjusting the percentage of pixels clipped.

### 6. Visualization Tools
- **Objective**: Provide functions to visualize both the images and their histograms.
- **Details**:
  - Plot histograms for each band (or grayscale image).
  - Provide comparison plots to show original vs. processed image and histograms.
  
## Future Extensions
- **Color Histogram Equalization**: Allow histogram manipulation across color channels, preserving color balance.
- **GPU Support**: Accelerate computations using GPU for large-scale image processing tasks.
- **Batch Processing**: Enable users to process multiple images simultaneously.

## Usage
- **Input**: Images can be input either as file paths or NumPy arrays.
- **Output**: Processed images will be returned as NumPy arrays and optionally saved to file.
- **Visualization**: Optional plotting of histograms and images for comparison.

## Next Steps
- Set up the project structure.
- Develop core utilities for image input and visualization.
- Implement each of the histogram manipulation techniques.
- Write unit tests for each module.
- Package and distribute the library.
